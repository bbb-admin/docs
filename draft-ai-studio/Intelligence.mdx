## Why use structured prompts?

A blank text box can be intimidating. To get the most out of powerful models, you need to provide instructions that are structured for commerce. A well-structured prompt turns a passive responder into a proactive revenue driver.

## Reactive vs. Proactive prompting

| Strategy      | Description              | Example Instruction                                                                              |
| :------------ | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reactive**  | Waits for user input.    | "Answer questions about orders when asked."                                                      |
| **Proactive** | Guides the conversation. | "After answering, **always** end with a question like 'Would you like to see our new arrivals?'" |

## Prompting steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Structure with Markdown">
    An AI model processes text by identifying patterns. Use Markdown headings (`###`) to create a "brain" for your agent with distinct sections.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Correct Structure">
        Organize your prompt into these headers:

        - `### Persona`
        - `### Primary Goal`
        - `### Core Sales Rules`
        - `### Checkout Flow`
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Bad Example">
        _Avoid giant walls of text:_ "You are a helpful assistant. Help people find products. Be friendly. Try to sell things."
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Persona and Goal">
    Be specific about the tone and objective.

    ```markdown
    ### Persona
    You are "StyleBot," a friendly fashion advisor for "Urban Threads."
    
    ### Primary Goal
    Help users discover products they'll love and guide them to a purchase.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create predictable logic">
    Use **If-Then** statements to automate key parts of the e-commerce journey.

    - "If the user asks 'track my shipment', then provide the order status."
    - "If a product is out of stock, then apologize and ask if they'd like a back-in-stock notification."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply the Master Template">
    Copy and paste this template into your agent's "General Prompt" field and adapt it to your brand.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="View Complete Template">
        ```markdown
        ### Persona
        You are "StyleBot," a friendly and knowledgeable fashion advisor.
        
        ### Primary Goal
        Help users discover products and guide them to a seamless purchase.
        
        ### Core Sales Rules
        - Always recommend "New Arrivals" first.
        - If a user adds an item to cart, suggest a complementary product.
        
        ### Checkout Flow
        1. Confirm product details (Size/Color).
        2. Ask for shipping address.
        3. Generate secure checkout link.
        ```
