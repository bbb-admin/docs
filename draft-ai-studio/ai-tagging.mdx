<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - **Role:** Admin access to the Agent configuration.
  - **Strategy:** Have a list of categories you want to track (e.g., Sentiment, Priority, Language).
</Info>

## Why use AI Tagging?

AI Tagging allows you to turn messy chat logs into structured data. Instead of manually reading every conversation, the AI analyzes the chat in real-time and applies labels like "Urgent Support," "High Value Lead," or "Spanish Speaker." This is essential for CRM syncing and analytics.

## Configuration steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the AI Tagging menu">
    1. Navigate to your active AI Agent.
    2. Select **AI Tagging** from the configuration menu.
    3. You will see a list of active tags (e.g., language, priority).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new tag">
    Click **Add new tag** to define a new category for the AI to track.

      <Accordion title="Field Definitions">
        - **Label Name:** The category name (e.g., `Priority`). Keep it short and descriptive.
        - **Label Description:** Explain to the AI _what_ this tag represents.
          - _Example:_ "Determine the urgency of the customer's issue."
        - **Values:** A comma-separated list of possible outputs.
          - _Example:_ `High, Medium, Low, Critical`
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define extraction logic">
    The "Label Description" field acts as a prompt. Be precise to get accurate data.

    - **Good Description:** "Identify if the customer is interested in buying flowers. Values: Yes, No, Maybe."
    - **Bad Description:** "Check flowers."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Activate">
    Click **Save**. The AI will now evaluate every incoming message against this rule and apply the tag when appropriate.
  </Step>
</Steps>
