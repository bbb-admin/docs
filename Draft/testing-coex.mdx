## What is Meta Coexistence?

Meta Coexistence allows you to use your WhatsApp Business App and the WhatsApp Cloud API simultaneously. This "hybrid" mode lets you automate messages via bitbybit while keeping your existing chat history on your phone.

**Understanding the trade-offs**

Before connecting, understand which features will remain active and which will be disabled on your phone once you switch to Coexistence mode.

| Feature | Status in Coexistence Mode |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1:1 Chats** | ✅ **Supported.** Chats are mirrored between phone and bitbybit. |
| **Chat History** | ✅ **Synced.** Up to 6 months of history is preserved. |
| **Group Chats** | ❌ **Not Supported.** Groups will not appear in bitbybit. |
| **Calls (Voice/Video)** | ❌ **Not Supported.** You cannot make calls via API. |
| **Disappearing Messages** | ❌ **Disabled.** This feature turns off for 1:1 chats. |
| **Broadcast Lists** | ❌ **Read-only.** You cannot create new lists on the phone. |
