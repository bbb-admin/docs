## Why use Meta Coexistence

Meta Coexistence allows you to use your **WhatsApp Business App** and the **WhatsApp Cloud API** simultaneously. This is the ideal solution for businesses that want to automate messages using bitbybit while keeping their existing chat history and the ability to reply via the mobile app.

**Feature Limitations**

Before connecting, understand how enabling the API changes your mobile app features.

| Feature | WhatsApp Mobile App | Cloud API (Coexistence) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1:1 Chats** | ✅ Supported | ✅ **Synced.** (History mirrors up to 6 months). |
| **Group Chats** | ✅ Supported | ❌ **Not Supported.** Groups do not sync to bitbybit. |
| **Calls** | ✅ Voice & Video | ❌ **Not Supported.** |
| **Broadcast Lists** | ✅ Supported | ❌ **Read-only.** You cannot send broadcasts from the app. |
| **Privacy Tools** | Disappearing / View Once | ❌ **Disabled** for all chats. |
