META Coexistence (Coex) allows you to use your WhatsApp Business App and the WhatsApp Cloud API simultaneously. This powerful feature lets you migrate to an API-based solution for automation and broadcasts without deactivating your current account, ensuring you keep your chat history.

For a visual walkthrough, please visit [our YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bitbybit.studio/videos) or watch the video below.

Using Meta Coexistence provides several key benefits:

* **Flexibility:** Use the Business App for personal, one-on-one chats while utilizing the API for automation and high-volume broadcasts.
* **Data Preservation:** You don't need to deactivate your existing account. Messages are "mirrored" between both platforms, preserving up to 6 months of 1:1 chat history.
* **Professionalism:** Manage high volumes of messages through the API while maintaining a single, professional contact number for a seamless customer experience.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites:** Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
  * A valid [Facebook Business Account](http://business.facebook.com/).
  * An active **WhatsApp Business App** phone number.
  * Completed [Meta Business Verification](https://knowledge.bitbybit.studio/bitcrm/how-to-create-and-connect-whatsapp-cloud-api) (both phone number and business verification).
