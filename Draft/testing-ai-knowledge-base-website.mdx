## Why use website sources

Connecting your website allows your AI agent to learn directly from your existing content, such as product documentation, blog posts, or shipping policies. This saves you from manually typing information into the agent's memory.

**Understanding Crawling Options:**

Before you begin, choose the right method for your needs.

| Feature | Single Page | Entire Website (Crawl) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Teaches the AI one specific topic. | Teaches the AI everything about your business. |
| **What it reads** | Only the specific URL you provide. | The URL + the Sitemap + all linked pages. |
| **Best for** | A specific blog post, a landing page, or a policy page. | Your main company website or help center. |
| **Example Input** | `https://bitbybit.studio/blog/update` | `https://bitbybit.studio` |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the URL">
    Enter a **Knowledge Title** (e.g., "Company Website") and paste your URL. Use the specific settings below based on your goal.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Option A: Add a Single Page">
        Use this to add a specific article or policy.
        1. Paste the full URL (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/shipping-policy`).
        2. **Uncheck** the "Crawl entire website" box.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Option B: Crawl Entire Website">
        Use this to index your whole site.
        1. Paste the **Root Domain** only (e.g., `https://yoursite.com`).
        2. **Check** the "Crawl entire website" box.
        
        <Warning>
        **Do not** use a sub-page (like `.../blog/post-1`) when crawling the entire site. The crawler needs the root domain to find the sitemap correctly.
        </Warning>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Sync">
    Click **Add** to finish. The status will change to "Training" or "Syncing." Once the status says **Active**, your AI knows this information.
