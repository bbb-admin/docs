<Info>
**Prerequisites**
* **Account:** A valid [Facebook Business Account](http://business.facebook.com/).
* **App:** An active **WhatsApp Business App** phone number.
* **Verification:** You must have completed [Meta Business Verification](https://knowledge.bitbybit.studio/bitcrm/how-to-create-and-connect-whatsapp-cloud-api).
</Info>

## Why use Meta Coexistence

Meta Coexistence allows you to use your **WhatsApp Business App** and the **WhatsApp Cloud API** simultaneously on the same phone number.

This is the best solution for businesses that want to:
* **Keep history:** You do not need to delete your existing WhatsApp account.
* **Automate:** Use bitbybit for broadcasts and chatbots.
* **Remain personal:** Continue using the mobile app for 1:1 customer support.

## Feature limitations

Before connecting, understand how Coexistence changes your current WhatsApp features. While basic chats sync, some mobile-specific features are disabled to support the API.

| Feature | WhatsApp Mobile App | Cloud API (bitbybit) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1:1 Chats** | ✅ Supported | ✅ **Synced.** (History mirrors up to 6 months). |
| **Group Chats** | ✅ Supported | ❌ **Not Supported.** Groups do not appear in bitbybit. |
| **Call Features** | ✅ Voice & Video Calls | ❌ **Not Supported.** |
| **Privacy Features** | Disappearing / View Once | ❌ **Disabled** for all chats. |
| **Broadcast Lists** | Read-only | ✅ **Supported** (Use bitbybit Broadcasts instead). |
| **Location Sharing** | Live Location | ❌ **Not Supported.** |
