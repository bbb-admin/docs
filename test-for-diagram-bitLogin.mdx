title: "Logging in to Shopify with bitLogin"
---

This guide explains how you can sign up and log in to your Shopify customer account using either the standard Shopify login or **bitLogin** (social login with Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.).\
It also covers why some login attempts may fail and how to avoid these issues.

## 1. Understanding Your Login Options

You can access your Shopify account in two ways:

1. **Shopify Login**
   - Use your email and password set when signing up via Shopify.
2. **bitLogin**
   - Use a social account (Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.).
   - **Important:** Every time you log in with bitLogin, your Shopify password will be automatically reset for security reasons.

## 2. Signing Up for the First Time

- **Sign up via Shopify:**\
  You will create a Shopify customer account by entering your first name, last name, email, and password.
- **Sign up via bitLogin:**\
  A new Shopify customer account will be created automatically using your social account details.

---

## 3. How Password Reset Works with bitLogin

When you log in using bitLogin, Shopify will reset your account password automatically.\
This means:

- If you try to log in later using **Shopify login** (email/password), it may fail because the password has changed.
- To log in again via Shopify after using bitLogin, you must reset your password first.

## 4. Successful Login Scenarios ✅

From customer testing, the following sequences work without any issues:

1. **Sign up with Shopify → Sign in with Shopify → Sign in with bitLogin**
   - Works fine. Password is only reset when you use bitLogin, but since the last login was bitLogin, future Shopify logins will require a reset.
2. **Sign up with bitLogin → Sign in with bitLogin → Sign in with Shopify** _(after resetting password)_
   - Works if password reset is completed before logging in with Shopify.
3. **Sign up with bitLogin → Sign in with Shopify → Sign in with bitLogin**
   - Works fine; just note that after using bitLogin again, the password is reset.
4. **Sign up with Shopify → Sign in with bitLogin → Sign in with Shopify** _(after resetting password)_
   - Works if password reset is completed before logging in with Shopify.

---

## 5. Failed Login Scenarios ❌

These happen when trying to log in with Shopify after using bitLogin, **without** resetting the password:

- **Sign up with bitLogin → Sign in with bitLogin → Sign in with Shopify (no password reset)**
  - Fails because bitLogin reset the password.
- **Sign up with Shopify → Sign in with bitLogin → Sign in with Shopify (no password reset)**
  - Fails for the same reason.

## 6. How to Avoid Login Problems

- **If you last logged in with bitLogin** → Always reset your password before trying Shopify login again.
- **If you only use Shopify login** → No reset needed; your password remains unchanged.
- **If you only use bitLogin** → No issues; just keep using social login.

## 7. Recommended Practice

To ensure smooth access:

- Decide on your primary login method and stick to it as much as possible.
- If you switch from bitLogin to Shopify login, reset your password first.
- Keep your email address consistent across both Shopify and bitLogin accounts to avoid account duplication.
