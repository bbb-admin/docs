## Why This Happens

When you log in with **bitLogin**, your Shopify password is automatically reset for security reasons.  
This means:
- Trying to log in later via **Shopify login** will fail unless you reset your password first.
- Using **bitLogin** again will always work because it doesn’t need your Shopify password.

## How to Reset Your Password

1. Go to Shopify login page.
2. Click **Forgot password?**
3. Check your email and follow the reset link.
4. Set your new password.
5. Use Shopify login again with the new password.

## Tips to Avoid Login Issues

- Decide your main login method and stick to it.
- If switching from bitLogin to Shopify login → always reset your password first.
- Keep the same email address for Shopify and bitLogin accounts to avoid duplicate profiles.

By following these quick steps, you can ensure your login always works without frustration.
