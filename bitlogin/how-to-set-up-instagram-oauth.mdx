title: "How to Set Up Instagram OAuth"
---

Integrating Instagram OAuth allows users to log in using their Instagram credentials, providing a fast, secure, and convenient authentication experience. With this integration, users don't need to create a new account, improving both retention and accessibility for your application.

## **Step 1:** **Register as a Developer**

* Visit [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new application.
* Select "Instagram" as the product to be used.

## **Step 2:** **Configure OAuth Client**

* Obtain the Client ID and Client Secret from the Instagram API.
* Set up a redirect URI that matches your application's requirements.

## **Step 3:** **Create an Authentication Request**

* Use Instagramâ€™s authorization endpoint to redirect users to the login page.
* Request the necessary permissions, such as access to user profiles and media.

## **Step 4:** **Handle Access Tokens**

* Once the user grants permission, exchange the authorization code for an access token.  
Use this token to retrieve user data from the Instagram Graph API.

## **Step 5:** **Ensure Security and Privacy**

* Store access tokens securely and refresh them periodically.
* Request only the necessary permissions to maintain user trust.
