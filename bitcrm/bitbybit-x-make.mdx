description: "This guide explains how to integrate bitbybit with Make.com so you can send automated WhatsApp template messages directly from your business workflows."
---

### ðŸ”— Step 1: Set up in [Make.com](http://Make.com)

1. Create a Scenario
   - Log in to [Make.com](http://Make.com)
   - Create a **New Scenario**
   - Add the apps or steps you need for your real business workflow (for example: trigger when a new order is placed, when a form is submitted, or when data is updated in your CRM).
2. Add Http Request Module
   - In your scenario, add an **HTTP module** â†’ choose **Make a Request**
   - This will be used to send messages through bitbybit's API.

### ðŸ”— Step 2: Prepare Your Bitbybit API Key

1. Go to [bitbybit Advance Settings](https://app.bitbybit.studio/settings?section=advance-settings)
2. Copy your **bitChat API Key** (you will need this in [Make.com](http://Make.com))

### ðŸ”— Step 3: Configure HTTP Request in [Make.com](http://Make.com)

Set up your HTTP Request as follows:

Method : `POST` 

URL : 

```
https://api.bitbybit.studio/whatsapp/v3.1/message/template
```

Headers : 

```
x-bitbybit-key: {{paste-your-bitchat-api-key-here}}
```

Body Example (JSON) : 

```
{
  "to": "6281234567890",
  "template_name": "welcome_message",
  "template_source": "CRM",
  "params": [
    "John",
    "Order123",
    "2024-01-01"
  ]
}
```

**_Payload Explanation : _**

- **to** â†’ The recipientâ€™s phone number (must include country code, e.g., `62` for Indonesia)
- **template_name** â†’ The name of the template you have already created in bitbybit.
- **template_source** â†’
  - Use `AUTH` if the template is for OTP (one-time password).
  - Use `CRM` for all other types (e.g., welcome messages, reminders, updates)
- **params** â†’ These are the **dynamic variables** in your template.

  ðŸ‘‰ Example for **params ]**

  If your template looks like this:

  ```
  Hello {{1}}, your order {{2}} will be delivered on {{3}}.
  ```

  Then your params must have **3 values** in the same order:

```
"params": [
  "John",          // {{1}} will be replaced with "John"
  "Order123",      // {{2}} will be replaced with "Order123"
  "2024-01-01"     // {{3}} will be replaced with "2024-01-01"
]
```

If your template has 2 variables, you must send 2 values. If it has none, leave `params` as an empty list `[]`.
