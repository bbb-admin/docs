Ensure your automated workflows function as expected by testing and previewing them within bitCRM. This guide walks you through the process of verifying your automation setup before it goes live, helping to prevent errors and optimize performance.

## **Step 1: Access the bitCRM Automation Dashboard**

* Go to the [bitCRM Automation](https://app.bitbybit.studio/bitcrm/automation-new) dashboard.

## **Step 2:** **Create Your Automation**

* Before you can test and preview your automation, you need to create an automation. Follow the details in [How to Create an Automation](https://www.bitbybit.studio/knowledge-base/how-to-create-an-automation) to get started.

## **Step 3: Test and Preview Your Automation**

* After creating an automation test, go to [Livechat](https://app.bitbybit.studio/bitchat/livechat). Your automation messages should be automatically sent according to its trigger(s), which you can preview in the Livechat conversations.
