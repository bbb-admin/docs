title: "How to Integrate bitbybit using Meta Coexistence"
---

META Coexistence (Coex) facilitates the simultaneous operation of the WhatsApp Business App and the Cloud API. This key feature allows SMBs to migrate to an API-based solution without deactivating their current account, thereby ensuring the preservation of their existing chat history..

This provides major benefits:

1. **Flexibility and Cost-Efficiency:** User can use the free app for personal, one-on-one chats while using the powerful API for automation, chatbots, and high-volume broadcasts. This mix optimizes costs.
2. **No Lost Data:** Businesses can adopt the API without deactivating their account. All messages are "mirrored" and synced between both platforms, preserving conversation history. All contacts are imported automatically. You can also choose to import up to 6 months of 1:1 chats and 2 weeks of multi-media history (group chats are not imported).
3. **Scalability & Professionalism:** Companies can manage a high volume of messages using the API and still maintain a single, professional number for a seamless customer experience.

**Important**

The following are the requirements before integration:

1. A valid [Facebook Business ](http://business.facebook.com/)account.
2. An active **WhatsApp Business App** phone number.
3. The [Meta Verification ](https://knowledge.bitbybit.studio/bitcrm/how-to-create-and-connect-whatsapp-cloud-api)process has been completed (phone number verification and business verification).
