## How your AI works

Your AI has two parts that work together:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Part A: System Prompt" icon="brain">
    **Runs on every message**
    
    This is your AI's personality — its name, tone of voice, greeting, and the rules it always follows. Think of it as your AI's brain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Part B: Knowledge Base" icon="book">
    **Searched when needed**
    
    This is your AI's reference library — FAQs, store locations, policies, and promotions. The AI searches here when customers ask detailed questions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What goes where?

| Put in Part A (System Prompt) | Put in Part B (Knowledge Base) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Agent name & personality | Detailed product info |
| Welcome message | Store locations & hours |
| Rules that always apply | FAQ answers |
| Escalation triggers | Current promotions |
| Upselling scripts | Return & shipping policies |

---

## Part A: System Prompt

The system prompt defines who your AI is and how it behaves in every conversation.

### A1. Agent Identity

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
**Agent Name** — The name your AI uses when greeting customers. Keep it short and memorable. Examples: "Adi", "Rasa", "Maya"

**Brand Name** — Your business name as customers know it.

**Brand Description** — Explain what you sell and who you serve. This helps your AI understand your business context.

*Example:*
> "adidas Indonesia is a sportswear brand selling athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories to athletes and lifestyle customers who value performance and style."
</Accordion>

### A2. Conversation Style

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
**Primary Language** — The language your AI starts conversations in. It will automatically switch if customers respond in a different language.

**Tone of Voice** — How should your AI sound?
- **Professional & Helpful** — Best for B2B, electronics, services
- **Friendly & Casual** — Best for fashion, lifestyle, retail
- **Energetic & Fun** — Best for sports, entertainment, F&B
- **Warm & Caring** — Best for beauty, wellness, kids products

**Personality Details** — Add specific phrases, emoji preferences, or language quirks.

*Example:*
> "Address customers as 'Kak'. Use food emojis naturally 🍔🍟. Keep responses short (2-3 sentences)."
</Accordion>

### A3. Welcome Message

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
This is the first message customers see when they start a conversation. A great welcome message has three parts:

1. **Greeting** — Warm, branded hello
2. **Value** — What you offer or what's popular
3. **Action** — Clear next step

*Example:*
> "Halo Kak! 👋 Selamat datang di McDonald's!
>
> Mau pesan Big Mac, McChicken, atau menu lainnya? Langsung aja, aku bantu!"
>
> [Button: Lihat Menu]

**Button Text** — The call-to-action button shown with your welcome message. Examples: "Lihat Menu", "Lihat Katalog", "Mulai Belanja"
</Accordion>

### A4. Business Rules (Optional)

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
Add critical rules your AI should always enforce. Keep this focused — detailed policies go in the Knowledge Base.

**Delivery & Orders** — Minimum orders, delivery fees, estimated times
> "Free shipping for orders above Rp 500,000. Standard delivery 3-5 business days."

**Product Guarantees** — Quality promises, certifications
> "All products 100% authentic. 30-day return for unworn items with tags."

**Important Restrictions** — Things your AI should never promise
> "Never guarantee stock availability without checking. Cannot combine promo codes."
</Accordion>

### A5. Escalation Triggers (Optional)

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
List keywords or situations that should transfer the conversation to a human agent.

*Examples:*
- Quality issues: "defective, broken, wrong item, fake"
- Order problems: "refund, return, cancel, missing"
- Direct requests: "talk to human, speak to agent"
- Complex needs: "bulk order, corporate, partnership"
</Accordion>

### A6. Forbidden Actions (Optional)

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
Tell your AI what it should never do.

*Examples:*
- "Never promise exact delivery dates"
- "Never offer unauthorized discounts"
- "Never mention competitor brands"
- "Never guarantee specific promotional items"
</Accordion>

### A7. Upselling (Optional)

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
Define when and how your AI should suggest additional items. Good upselling feels helpful, not pushy.

**Structure your upsell:**
1. **When** — The trigger situation
2. **Suggest** — What to recommend
3. **Script** — Exact words to use

*Example:*
> When: Customer orders burger only (no meal)
> Suggest: Upgrade to meal package
> Script: "Kak, mending jadi paket aja! Tambah Rp 15,000 udah dapat fries + drink."
</Accordion>

### A8. Checkout (Optional)

<Accordion title="What to fill in">
**Customer Selections** — What customers need to specify before ordering. Examples: Size, Color, Quantity, Spice Level, Add-ons

**Payment Methods** — Check all the payment methods you accept:
- Bank Transfer (BCA, Mandiri, BNI, etc.)
- E-wallet (ShopeePay, OVO, DANA, GoPay)
- QRIS
- Credit/Debit Card
</Accordion>
