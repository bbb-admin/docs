## How your AI works

Your AI has two parts that work together:

| Part A: Advanced Prompt                                                   | Part B: Knowledge Base                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Runs on every message**                                                 | **Searched when needed**                                             |
| Your AI's personality — name, tone, greeting, and rules it always follows | Your AI's reference library — FAQs, store info, policies, promotions |
| Think of it as your AI's _brain_                                          | Think of it as your AI's _memory_                                    |

**Quick rule:** Put personality and critical rules in Part A. Put detailed reference info in Part B.

## Filling out the form

The form includes examples from two brands — adidas (e-commerce) and McDonald's (restaurant). Copy the example closest to your business and customize it.

### Part A: System Prompt

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="A1. Agent Identity (Required)">
    **What to fill in:**

    - **Agent Name** — Keep it short and memorable (e.g., "Helper", "Fashion ai", "Chef bot")
    - **Brand Name** — Your business name as customers know it
    - **Brand Description** — What you sell and who you serve

    **Tip:** Your brand description helps the AI understand context. Be specific about your products and target customers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A2. Conversation Style">
    **What to fill in:**

    - **Primary Language** — The AI auto-switches based on customer language
    - **Tone of Voice** — Match your brand personality
    - **Personality Details** — Specific phrases, emoji preferences, quirks

    **Tip:** Instead of "be friendly," be specific: "Address customers as 'Bro' and use food emojis 🍔🍟"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A3. Welcome Message (Required)">
    This is the first message customers see. Structure it as:

    1. **Greeting** — Warm, brand hello
    2. **Value** — What you offer or what's popular
    3. **Action** — Clear next step + button

    **Tip:** Keep it short (3-4 lines max). End with a call-to-action button like "Lihat Menu" or "Start Shopping".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A4. Business Rules (Optional)">
    Add critical rules your AI must always follow:

    - Delivery minimums and fees
    - Product guarantees
    - Important restrictions

    **Tip:** Only include rules that apply to every conversation. Detailed policies go in Part B.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A5. Escalation Triggers (Optional)">
    List keywords or situations that should transfer to a human:

    - Quality issues (defective, broken, wrong item)
    - Refund/return requests
    - "Talk to human" — always escalate this

    **Tip:** When in doubt, escalate. It's better to hand off than frustrate a customer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A6. Forbidden Actions (Optional)">
    Tell your AI what to never do:

    - Never promise exact delivery dates
    - Never offer unauthorized discounts
    - Never mention competitors

    **Tip:** Think about past customer service issues. What promises caused problems?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A7. Upselling (Optional)">
    Structure your upsell with:

    - **When** — The trigger situation
    - **Suggest** — What to recommend

    **Tip:** Good upselling feels helpful, not pushy. Frame it as value for the customer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A8. Checkout (Optional)">
    Define what customers need to specify (size, color, quantity) and which payment methods you accept.

    **Payment priority:** Bank Transfer → E-wallet/ QRIS → Card
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Part B: Knowledge Base

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B1. Files">
    Upload documents your AI can reference:

    - Product catalog or menu
    - Size guide
    - Return policy
    - Shipping info

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B2. Websites">

    https://yoursite.com/faq
    https://yoursite.com/shipping
    https://yoursite.com/returns
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B3. Images">
    Upload visuals your AI can send to customers. For each image, specify when to send it:

    - Size Chart → "when customer asks about sizing"
    - Promo Banner → "when customer asks about discounts"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="B4. Text Entries">
    Type information directly:

    - **Store Locations** — Addresses and hours
    - **FAQ** — Common questions and answers
    - **Promotions** — Current deals and promo codes
    - **Policies** — Returns, shipping, etc.

    **Tip:** Keep promotions updated. Outdated promotion frustrate customers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
