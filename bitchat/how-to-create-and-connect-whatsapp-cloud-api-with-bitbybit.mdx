## Requirements Before You Start

- **Verified Meta Business Manager**: Your business must be verified by Meta with legal documents.
- **Admin Access to Meta Business Manager**: Ensure you have full control access in your Business Manager account.
- **A Phone Number (Clean & Unused)**:
  - Not currently used on any WhatsApp (personal or business).
  - Can receive SMS or phone calls for verification.
  - If your number is active on WhatsApp, you must delete the WhatsApp account first. Follow steps 3-5 of this process.

⚠️ Make sure your Facebook account has Full Control (Admin Access) in Business Settings → People. This is required to continue the integration process.

## Step 2: Verify Your Business Manager

- In Business Settings, go to Security Center → Business Verification.

- On the "Fill in your business information", click the "Business portfolio" dropdown and choose between:
  - Create a business portfolio and fill in details like "Business name," "Business email," "Business website or profile page," and "Country".
  - Or select an existing business portfolio from the dropdown, which will auto-fill the form.
- Click "Next".

## Step 6: Create or Select Your WhatsApp Business Account

- On the "Create or select your WhatsApp Business Account", click the "Create a WhatsApp Business Account" and “Create or Choose WhatsApp Business Profile” dropdown and choose between:
  - Choose "Create a WhatsApp Business Account" and in the next dropdown, "Create a new WhatsApp Business Profile."
  - Fill in "WhatsApp Business Account Name," "WhatsApp Business display name," and "Category". Then click “Next”.
  - Or select an existing “WhatsApp Business account” and, in the "Create or choose WhatsApp Business Profile" dropdown, choose to "Create a new WhatsApp Business profile."

⚠️ Importance! You can create multiple profiles on your WhatsApp Business account.

## Step 7: Add A Phone Number for WhatsApp

## Step 8: Add Payment Method

- Complete the process by clicking "Add payment method".
- Please pay attention: To unlock additional features and other advanced functionalities, you need to add a payment method.
  - If you skip adding a payment method, your WhatsApp Cloud API will still be connected, but some features will be restricted like message templates and campaigns.

To fully activate your WhatsApp Cloud API and unlock all messaging features, you need to add a payment method in Meta Business Manager. Please follow the steps below carefully:

- Go to Business Settings at [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com).
- In the left sidebar, select Settings and click WhatsApp Accounts.
- Select the WhatsApp Business Account you’ve just connected.
- Scroll down and click Payment Settings.
- Click Add Payment Method and complete the required billing details.
- Fill in all Business Information as requested (name, legal entity, billing address, etc).
- After saving, make sure there are no alerts or warnings on the payment settings page.

## Step 9: Test Your WhatsApp API

After setting up WhatsApp Cloud API including adding the payment method, send a test message, test it by sending a message using a Campaign, Automation, or Chat Initiation template. Follow these guides to create your template:

- Campaign: Create Template Campaign
- Automation: Create Template Automation
- Chat Initiation: Create Template Chat Initiation

Note that Meta categorizes messages into conversation rate: Authentication, Marketing, Utility, Service. Check Meta’s pricing details here.

Once your template is created, test it in bitbybit’s LiveChat page to ensure it sends and receives successfully.

⚠️ If the message successfully delivers, your integration is 100% complete.
⚠️ If it fails, recheck the steps above, especially your payment status and phone number verification.

The message you sent should appear on the bitbybit Livechat page.
