Fulfill items in a customer order, upload payment proof if needed, and generate an invoice for recordkeeping or delivery. This guide walks you through the steps to confirm delivery, manage payments, and utilize internal notes for your team.

## Fulfill and Manage Orders Process

**Step 1: Access the Order Dashboard**

Navigate to the **Commerce** or **Orders** section in your bitbybit dashboard to view your current order list.

**Step 2: Select the Order and Fulfill**

1. **Click** on the relevant order you wish to process.
2. **Click** the **"Fulfill Item"** button.
3. **Fill** in the necessary fields (such as tracking numbers or shipping details).
4. **Click "Fulfill"** to confirm.

⚠️ **Important:** If the order must be split due to stock limitations, you will need to partially fulfill it. See How to Partially Fulfill Item for details.

**Step 3: Capture Payment**

If the order requires manual payment verification:

1. **Fill in** the payment note.
2. **Upload** the proof of payment file.
3. **Click "Capture Payment"** to finalize the financial transaction record.

**Step 4: Print Invoice**

To generate a physical or digital copy of the order for your records or the customer:

1. **Click "Print Invoice"**.
2. Save or print the document as needed.

**Step 5: Leave Internal Notes in Timeline (Optional)**

After fulfilling the order or capturing payment, you can leave internal notes for your team. These notes are **only visible to you and other staff** and are useful for recording manual actions or specific customer details.

1. Navigate to the **Timeline** tab.
2. Type your internal note or comment.
3. **Submit** the note.

> **Note:** You can find the **Timeline** at the bottom section of the order detail view.

**Congratulations! You have successfully fulfilled a commerce order.**
