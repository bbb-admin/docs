title: Understanding Your Order Statuses on Commerce
---

Orders in your dashboard are categorized by multiple statuses, including **order status**, **payment status**, and **fulfillment status**. These statuses help you monitor the progress of each order.

You can filter and manage your orders more efficiently by combining these statuses in your views. Below is a detailed breakdown of what each status means.

## Order Status

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Active** | The order is ongoing. There are still actions required, such as processing payment, handling shipping, or fulfilling the items. Similar to **Open** status in Shopify. |
| **Done** | The order is completed and no further action is needed. Usually means the order has been paid and fulfilled. Aligns with **Archived** status in Shopify. |
| **Cancelled** | The order has been canceled and will not be processed. If not fully refunded, some actions may still be required. Equivalent to **Canceled** in Shopify. |

## Payment Status

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Paid** | Payment has been successfully received, either automatically or manually. Equivalent to **Paid** in Shopify. |
| **Unpaid** | Payment has not been made or is pending. This can include cases like Pending, Authorized, or Expired. Matches **Unpaid** in Shopify. |
| **Refunded** | The full amount paid has been refunded to the customer. Same as **Refunded** in Shopify. |

## Fulfillment Status
