Manually adding products to your bitbybit Commerce store allows you to customize your catalog, manage inventory, and sync items directly to your WhatsApp Business profile. Follow this guide to fill in all necessary product details correctly.

## Requirements Before You Start

- **Access to Commerce:** You must have access to the Commerce section of your bitbybit dashboard.
- **Product Images:** Have your product visuals ready (JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, or SVG formats, max 5MB).
- **WhatsApp API:** Ensure your WhatsApp Cloud API or WhatsApp Coex  is connected if you plan to sync the catalog immediately.

## Add Product Process

**Step 1: Enter Product Details**

1. Navigate to the **Products** page in your dashboard and click **"Add Product"**.
2. In the **Product detail** section, enter a clear **Title** for your item.
3. Add a detailed **Description** in the text box. You can use the formatting tools (bold, italic, etc.) to style your text.
4. Upload your product visual in the **Image** section. You can drag and drop your file or click to browse.

> **Note:** Supported files are jpeg, png, gif, tiff, and svg. The maximum file size is 5MB.

**Step 2: Manage Inventory and Variants**

1. Scroll down to the **Inventory** section.
2. Enter the **Brand** and **SKU** (Stock Keeping Unit). These fields are optional but recommended for better tracking.
3. Check the box **"This is a physical product"** if applicable.
4. Ensure the **Available to purchase** toggle is turned **ON** (green) so customers can buy the item immediately.
5. If your product has different versions (like sizes or colors), click **"Add variant"** in the **Variant** section to configure them.

**Step 3: Set Pricing and Organization**

1. On the right-hand side panel, locate the **Pricing** section.
2. Enter the **Price** amount.
3. You can optionally check **"Show compare at price"** if you want to display a discount or original price.
4. Under **Product type**, select the appropriate category from the dropdown menu.
5. Add any relevant **Tags** to help organize and filter your products.

**Step 4: Sync to WhatsApp Catalog**

1. In the **WhatsApp catalog** section (top right), toggle the switch to **Display product on WhatsApp catalog**.
2. You can monitor the **Meta status and issues** section below the catalog toggle to see if your product is published or pending review.

⚠️ **Important:** Displaying the product to the WhatsApp Catalog may take **15+ minutes** due to the Meta synchronization process.

**Step 5: Save Your Product**

Once all information is entered and double-checked, click the **Save product** button in the top right corner of the screen.

**Congratulations! You have successfully added a new product to your store.**

Happy selling!
